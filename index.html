<img src="/home/bootcamp/2017/02/27/IMG_8964.JPG"lenght="20%" height="20

<p><strong>The Victorian Gothic-style Clock Tower has always been an icon of old docks</strong>. Situated near the site of the original Bertie's Landing Restaurant, the Waterfront Clock Tower acted as the original Port Captain's office.
Construction of the Clock Tower was completed in 1882.</p>
<p>The second floor of the <strong>Clock Tower is a decorative mirror room, where the Port Captain could check on all the activities</strong> in the harbor.
The bottom floor features a tide-gauge mechanism that was used to check the level of the tide.</p>
<br></br>
<h1><li style="color:#030f00"><strong>African Trading Port</strong></li></h1>
<img src="http://l7.alamy.com/zooms/fb485b2c626f4bf09ca049c4b8eef124/cape-town-south-africa-african-trading-port-at-the-victoria-and-alfred-gery7a.jpg" length="20%" width="40%" height="20%" ></img>
<p>Artwork from <strong>practically each African country and culture is available.</strong> ATP’s roots started with the establishment of an art workshop in Zimbabwe in 1978. We have been housed in our current location;
the Old Port Captain’s Building at Cape Town’s Waterfront since 2001.</p>

<h1><li style="color:#030f00"><strong>Swing Bridge</strong></li></h1>
<img src="/home/bootcamp/2017/02/27/IMG_8959.JPG"length="20%" heigth="20%"width=40%></img>
<p><strong>A swing bridge is a movable bridge that has as its primary structural support a vertical locating pin and support ring,</strong> usually at or near to its center of gravity,
about which the turning span can then pivot horizontally as shown in the animated illustration to the right.</p>
<p><strong>Walking across the swing bridge (look out for the Cape fur seals on a landing to your right as you cross), you come to the stocky square building known as Union Castle Building (1919),</strong>
designed by the firm of architects owned by Sir Herbert Baker.</p>
